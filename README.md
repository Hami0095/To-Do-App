# To-Do-App

I am sorry for adding the GridTiles at the homePage but not completing it, if anyone want to fork this project and add the category in this project, you are invited. Furthermore, this project has following goals that are completed : 
  1. You can add a task on the realtime Firebase Database
  2. You can edit your task
  3. You can remove the task
  4. Provider class is used for State Management
  5. Http requests for the database read/write stuff.
